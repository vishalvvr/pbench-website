## Pbench

Pbench is a harness that allows data collection from a variety of tools while running a benchmark. Pbench has some built-in scripts that run some common benchmarks, but the data collection can be run separately as well with a benchmark that is not built-in to Pbench, or a Pbench script can be written for the benchmark. Such contributions are more than welcome!
